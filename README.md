Spring Integration Templates
============================

This repository contains templates and plugins that will help you to get Spring Integration projects off the ground quickly. For right now the following sub-projects exist:

* Spring Integration STS Plugin and Templates (**si-sts-templates**)
* Spring Integration Gradle Plugin (**si-gradle-plugin**)

Both the STS support and the Gradle Plugin use the same set of template projects, which are located under **si-template-projects**
